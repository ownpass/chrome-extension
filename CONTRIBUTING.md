# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/ownpass/chrome-extension).

## Pull Requests

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any 
other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0][link-semver]. 
Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, 
send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull 
request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while 
developing, please [squash them][link-squash] before submitting.

## Running Tests
